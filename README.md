### Note* this implementation is still incomplete

### Reference notes to remember where we've been:

# Part II Tree Walk Interpreter

## Chapter 4 Scanning
(Also know as Lexing or Tokenizing)

### Interpreter Framework

* Iterate over each character in the source code text to find meaningful 'chunks' called tokens
